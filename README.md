Tested on Debian linux (latest kali), should work on Windows but I havent tested it on Windows yet!

At the moment it is in very early development, I have added a hitbox system and collision detection. -> testproject.cpp.
There is a menu that allows you to create projects and view them (can't load or delete them yet).

Just compile testproject.cpp using ```g++ -g testproject.cpp -o *name of your executable* ``` and have fun!
